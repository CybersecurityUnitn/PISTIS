Some tests in this directory are run in a msp430-specific "torture" style,
where all target specific options (that change code generation) that are
expected to produce an executable for the given MCU without error are each used
on each test source file in turn.

The criteria for this torture style of testing is:
  - The source file has a .c suffix
  - The source file is in this "devices" subdirectory of the msp430 tests
  - Somewhere in the test file name matches the regex:
    [a-z0-9]+430[a-z0-9_]+(?=\.c).
    The non-capturing part of this regex will be used as the MCU name, to
    ascertain which multilib this device supports.

Some of the options used to run the tests will produce warnings for the mcus,
so ensure the test has dg-warning directives as appropriate.
